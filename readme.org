#+TITLE: Spotty

A helper for opening spotify urls in a running spotify instance, on linux,
implemented using clojure and babashka.

Named after the spotify linux client's support for this feature.


* TODO remove `sp` dependency
Could probably just fire into spotify dbus directly
* TODO figure out what to do with regular urls
Calling xdg-open again feels like a loop, b/c that's how this gets called
